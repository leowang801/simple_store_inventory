# Store Inventory Personal Project
## By: Zeyu (Leo) Wang
For my personal project, I will make a program that keeps track of a store's
inventory. It will be a database to keep track of all items that go in and out of
the inventory. The user will be able to:
- Add or remove any quantity of an item from the inventory. 
- See a log that keeps track of the time, date, and quanitity of items that 
were added or removed from the inventory. 
- Get alerts if a certain item is low in stock
- See a summary of the sales statistics of all items 

My project will be useful for store owners to keep track of their inventory to
know when they need to restock certain items, the sales trends for each 
item, and prevent theft or misplacement of items. It will make the job of
keeping track of a store's inventory automated, which would be especially 
useful for smaller businesses with less budget or manpower. I am interested
in this project because of a similar reason. My friends and I wish to 
participate in an affiliate marketing program to earn some money on the side.
A problem that we encountered was being able to efficiently track the sales
that we would help make because our target goal for sales is very large. 
Furthermore, seeing the statistics of what products we had the most success
selling would allow us to focus our marketing efforts more effectively.
